# Bike-Sharing evaluation
A case-study of Bike-Sharing in Hamburg as explorative data-analysis and machine learning experiment
## Abstract
Bike-sharing is an increasingly popular form of sustainable transport, while the effectiveness of bike-sharing systems is largely dependent on infrastructure balance. This study proposes an in-terpretable attention-based TFT model in a comparative evaluation experiment. Furthermore, the study analyses key factors influencing bike-sharing activity in a novel case study in Hamburg, Germany. The proposed TFT model outperforms the comparative state-of-the-art model with a 36.8% improvement in RSME and overcomes current black-box models through interpretability. Based on the results, practical interventions and implementation of the proposed model can improve the balance of bike-sharing infrastructure and consequently the effectiveness, sustaina-bility, and user retention of bike-sharing.
